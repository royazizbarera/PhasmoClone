## Development

The main goal of this project for me was to build a good project architecture. I was using all SOLID principles, dependency injection and Factory pattern to get rid of Singleton "God" objects. All other technologies, that was used in this projects: 
- Factory Pattern
- State Pattern
- Object Pool
- Addressables
- Observer pattern
- Unity new input system
- Scriptable Objects
